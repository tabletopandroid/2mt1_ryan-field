# 2MT1 - Ryan Field Airport

Ryan Field (2MT1) is a private airstrip owned by the RAF via the generous donation of Ben and Butchie Ryan. It is located one mile southeast of West Glacier, MT and is depicted on the Great Falls Sectional Chart.

Originally this scenery came about because of a flight I did with Virtual USA Flying Club. It was sporadic and I wanted to see if I could generate an airport quickly.

Freqency: 122.9
